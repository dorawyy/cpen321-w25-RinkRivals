            Our project has unfortunately been downscaled a bit due to a
            changing team size. This has mostly influenced the live event
            updating feature that we pivoted to a feature of the user filling
            out the bingo squares instead. This automatic update of filling out
            tickets is something that is time consuming but can be fit into our
            architecture as we already have the backend live game sync up a dn
            running and we would focus on this as the next milestone in further
            development of the project.

    <h2 id="2-project-description">2. Project Description</h2>
    <p>
      Our app is a social points game based on real life ice hockey games. The
      purpose of the game is to predict events and score bingos before your
      opponents. You play against each other with self made bingo tickets. These
      are composed of a 3x3 grid where you can pick an event for each box.
      Players should pick the events they find most likely and can win by
      getting bingos, meaning 3 in a row.
    </p>
    <hr />
    <h2 id="3-requirements-specification">3. Requirements Specification</h2>
    <h3 id="31-list-of-features"><strong>3.1. List of Features</strong></h3>
    <p>
      <strong>1. Sign up and authentication:</strong> Users need to sign in to
      use the app. New users need to sign up before they sign in. Signed in
      users can sign out or delete their account.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>2. Manage friends:</strong> A user can send friend requests to
      other users. Other users may accept or decline friend requests. If a user
      accepts a friend request, the user will become a friend and appear in the
      users friend list. Users can also delete friends.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>3. Manage bingo tickets:</strong> Users can create bingo tickets
      for upcoming hockey games. One game can be chosen for one ticket but
      multiple tickets may be made for one game. The user can fill their bingo
      ticket by selecting 9 events from a list and placing them in a 3x3 grid.
      When the bingo ticket is complete, the user can save it and view it in a
      tickets list. As the real life hockey game starts, the squares are filled
      in when the events are met (eg. VAN scores 3+ times).
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>4. Manage challenges:</strong> Users can create, delete, join,
      decline and leave challenges. The challenge will have a unique game
      related to it, and the challenge members will each have a ticket in the
      challenge for the same game. One ticket may be used for one challenge but
      multiple challenges may use the same ticket. The user who creates the
      challenge will become the challenge owner and can invite other players
      from their friends list. Users can view a specific challenge and see the
      state of all bingo tickets involved in the challenge.

        <p><strong>[Live updates]</strong></p>

          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Justification</strong>: The element of live interactivity is
            very important as the game depends on a live hockey event, and the
            game needs to be updated quickly for the user to follow the state of
            the challenge. We choose one minute as this is the maximum delay
            users are expecting for simple problems that they expect the
            computer to solve.

          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Justification</strong>: The core feature of our app is
            building bingo tickets and ideally this is where the user will spend
            the most time. Studies and UX standards indicate that response times
            under 1 second are perceived as instantaneous, maintaining the
            user’s sense of flow and engagement. This ensures users can quickly
            iterate and build tickets without frustration or cognitive
            interruption.
